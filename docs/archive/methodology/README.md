# Methodology

Meta-artifacts for tracking decisions, lessons learned, and project metrics.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `decisions/` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - captures "why" behind major technical choices |
| `lessons/` | Lessons learned per phase - what worked, what didn't, how to improve |
| `metrics/` | Aggregate metrics across sprints for trend analysis |

## When to Use

**ADRs**: Write one when making a significant technical or architectural decision that affects the project direction.

**Lessons**: Document after completing a major phase or when you discover something important.

**Metrics**: Track velocity, quality, and time data across sprints.
