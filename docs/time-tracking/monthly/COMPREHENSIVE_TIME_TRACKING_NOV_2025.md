## Gaps Identified

The following periods have minimal or inferred tracking:

1. **Nov 20-23**: 4 days with limited commit activity (planning period)
2. **Nov 25**: High commit volume (~12 commits) but no detailed time tracking
3. **Nov 28**: Current day - incomplete

**Recommendation**: These gaps should be filled in with actual session times when available, or marked as "inferred" based on commit volumes.

---

## Notes for Future Time Tracking

### What's Working Well ✅
- Detailed session tracking with start/end times
- Category breakdown (Planning, Development, Debugging, etc.)
- Task completion checkboxes
- Variance analysis
- Weekly summaries

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️
1. **Consistency**: Some days have detailed tracking, others don't
2. **Real-time Logging**: Log sessions as they happen, not retroactively
3. **Commit Correlation**: Better alignment between commits and session notes
4. **Inferred Sessions**: Clearly mark which sessions are inferred vs actual
5. **Break Time**: Track breaks to get accurate productive time
