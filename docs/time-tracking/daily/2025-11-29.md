**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

---

## Sessions

### Session 1
- **Start**: ~Afternoon
- **End**: ~Evening
- **Duration**: ~4 hours (estimated)
- **Activity**: Sprint 2 Code System Review research. Created CSI MasterFormat analysis document researching industry standard coding systems. Created Alternatives Analysis document covering Uniformat II, trade-based, and phase-based coding systems. Created Integration Compatibility document analyzing QuickBooks, EDI, and vendor compatibility. Created Hybrid System Design document with proposed trade-based SKU structure.
- **Category**: Research
- **Blockers**: None

## Daily Summary

**Total Time**: ~4 hours (estimated)
**Planned vs Actual**: 0 hours (on target)

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Research CSI MasterFormat (Divisions 01-50)
- [x] Create CSI_MASTERFORMAT_ANALYSIS.md
- [x] Research Uniformat II (Elements A-G)
- [x] Research trade-based and phase-based systems
- [x] Create ALTERNATIVES_ANALYSIS.md
- [x] Research vendor compatibility
- [x] Research QuickBooks/EDI integration
- [x] Create INTEGRATION_COMPATIBILITY.md
- [x] Design hybrid trade-based coding system
- [x] Create HYBRID_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md

**Outstanding Issues**:
- None

**Key Deliverables**:
- `docs/code-system/CSI_MASTERFORMAT_ANALYSIS.md` - Industry standard analysis
- `docs/code-system/ALTERNATIVES_ANALYSIS.md` - Uniformat II, trade-based systems
- `docs/code-system/INTEGRATION_COMPATIBILITY.md` - Vendor/EDI compatibility
- `docs/code-system/HYBRID_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Proposed hybrid design

**Blockers Encountered**: None

**Lessons Learned**:
- CSI MasterFormat is comprehensive but designed for commercial/institutional projects
- Uniformat II focuses on building systems rather than materials
- Trade-based organization (Framing, Plumbing, etc.) aligns with production builder workflows
- Need to review existing system before finalizing decision

**Tomorrow's Preparation**:
- [ ] Make final code system decision
- [ ] Review existing two-layer code system in database/schema
- [ ] Create implementation plan
