## Sessions

### Session 1
- **Start**: ~Morning
- **End**: ~Afternoon
- **Duration**: ~2 hours (estimated)
- **Activity**: Finalized Sprint 2 Code System decision. Discovered existing two-layer code system is 98% complete in database/schema/unified_code_system.sql. Updated DECISION.md to adopt existing system rather than creating new one. Created Week 48 weekly review. Created Week 4 time summary. Created Phase 1 review document. Updated running log with 11/29 and 11/30 entries. Created daily shutdown documentation.
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Blockers**: None

## Daily Summary

**Total Time**: ~2 hours (estimated)
**Planned vs Actual**: 0 hours (on target)

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Review existing two-layer code system
- [x] Update DECISION.md to use existing system
- [x] Create Week 48 weekly review
- [x] Create Week 4 time summary (Nov 24-30)
- [x] Create Phase 1 review document
- [x] Update running log with 11/29, 11/30 entries
- [x] Create daily shutdown for 11/29
- [x] Create daily shutdown for 11/30

**Outstanding Issues**:
- None

**Key Deliverables**:
- `docs/code-system/DECISION.md` - Final decision (use existing system)
- `docs/reviews/weekly/2025/week-48.md` - Week 48 review
- `docs/time-tracking/WEEK_4_SUMMARY_NOV_24-30.md` - Week 4 time summary
- `docs/reviews/phase/PHASE_1_REVIEW.md` - Phase 1 review
- `docs/time-tracking/daily/2025-11-29.md` - Daily shutdown
- `docs/time-tracking/daily/2025-11-30.md` - Daily shutdown (this file)

**Blockers Encountered**: None

**Lessons Learned**:
- **CRITICAL**: Always review existing documentation before starting new features
- Existing two-layer code system (unified_code_system.sql) is 98% complete
- Industry research provides supplementary context, not replacement
- Saved weeks of rework by discovering existing system

**Next Week's Preparation**:
- [ ] Begin Sprint 3: Database & API
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL production database
- [ ] Migrate unified_code_system.sql schema
- [ ] Import Holt/Richmond data

## Sprint 2 Code System Decision Summary

### Decision: USE EXISTING TWO-LAYER CODE SYSTEM

**Key Finding**: Platform already has comprehensive code system at 98% completion.

**Existing System Location**:
- Schema: `database/schema/unified_code_system.sql`
- Design: `docs/archive/analysis/LAYERED_CODE_SYSTEM_DESIGN_2025-11-14.md`
- Data: `database/schema/Coding_Schema_20251113.csv` (312 pack definitions)

**Two-Layer Architecture**:
- Layer 1: `PLAN-PHASE/OPTION-MATERIALCLASS` (e.g., `1234-20.00-1000`)
- Layer 2: SKU-level materials linked via `code_id`

**Why NOT Build New**:
1. Already 98% complete
2. 312 pack definitions, 150+ phase codes, 50+ Richmond mappings
3. Months of existing design work
4. Tested against real data

**Research Files (Supplementary Only)**:
- CSI_MASTERFORMAT_ANALYSIS.md
- ALTERNATIVES_ANALYSIS.md
- INTEGRATION_COMPATIBILITY.md
- HYBRID_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
